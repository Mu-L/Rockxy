# Contributing

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Setup

You'll need macOS 14.0+, Xcode 16+, [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint), and [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RockxyApp/Rockxy.git
cd Rockxy
git checkout develop
```

Build:

```bash
xcodebuild -project Rockxy.xcodeproj -scheme Rockxy -configuration Debug build
```

Run tests:

```bash
xcodebuild -project Rockxy.xcodeproj -scheme Rockxy test
```

## Code Style

`.swiftlint.yml` and `.swiftformat` are the source of truth. The short version:

- 4-space indentation, 120-char line length target
- Explicit access control (`private`, `internal`, `public`)
- No force unwraps or force casts. Use `guard let`, `if let`, `as?`
- `String(localized:)` for user-facing strings. SwiftUI view literals auto-localize
- OSLog only, no `print()`

Run both before committing:

```bash
swiftlint lint --strict
swiftformat .
```

## Commits

## Branch Naming

Branch off `develop`:

- `feat/add-grpc-support`
- `fix/proxy-connection-leak`
- `docs/update-quickstart`

## Pull Requests

All pull requests must target the **`develop`** branch. One change per PR. Make sure tests pass and lint is clean. Link related issues.

Rockxy merges accepted external pull requests with a merge commit so the exact
reviewed contributor commit SHAs remain in project history. Squash and rebase
merges are disabled; contributors do not need to change their normal PR flow.

Before opening, check:

- [ ] Tests added or updated
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated under `[Unreleased]` (skip for unreleased-only fixes)
- [ ] Docs updated in `docs/` if the change affects user-facing behavior
- [ ] User-facing strings localized
- [ ] If string catalogs changed, `python3 .github/tools/validate_xcstrings.py` passes
- [ ] No SwiftLint/SwiftFormat violations
- [ ] If the change touches helper packaging, release scripts, or platform compatibility claims, Intel + Apple Silicon validation was updated or re-run

## Translations

Rockxy ships native Xcode String Catalogs (`Rockxy/Localizable.xcstrings` and
`Rockxy/InfoPlist.xcstrings`); the Git-tracked catalogs are canonical and there is
an app-language picker under **Settings › Appearance › Language**. **System Default**
follows the macOS language; choosing another bundled language updates Rockxy
immediately. To add or improve a language, edit the catalogs in Xcode, preserve every
placeholder and plural/format token, then validate before pushing:

```bash
python3 .github/tools/validate_xcstrings.py
```

A maintainer reviews every `.xcstrings` change; this gates review, not authorship.
See [`docs/development/localization.mdx`](docs/development/localization.mdx) for the
full workflow, catalog hygiene, and placeholder rules.

## Reporting Bugs

Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/RockxyApp/Rockxy/issues) with your macOS version, Rockxy version, and reproduction steps.

## Contributor License Agreement

All contributors must accept the current
[Individual Contributor License Agreement v2.0](legal/cla/ICLA-v2.0.md) before
their pull request can be merged. When you open a PR, the `Rockxy CLA` check
posts a comment asking each contributor to accept. Read the ICLA, then post this
exact comment on the pull request:

```text
I have read and agree to the Rockxy ICLA v2.0
```

The `Rockxy CLA` status turns green once every contributor on the PR has
accepted. Accepting the ICLA v2.0 covers the contributions in that pull request
and your later Contributions while that version is in effect; a signature from a
different, later pull request does not cover an earlier-opened one, and a later
material agreement version requires new acceptance. Acceptance is recorded as an
append-only-by-workflow evidence record on the dedicated `cla-signatures` branch.

You retain copyright in your Contribution. The ICLA gives the Project Owner the
rights needed to publish it in the AGPL Community source edition and to use it
in separately licensed Rockxy distributions. Contributions incorporated into
the public source edition remain available there under its public source
license.

If your employer or another organization owns or controls your Contribution,
an authorized representative must also execute the
[Corporate Contributor License Agreement](legal/cla/CCLA-v1.0.md). Contact
`rockxyapp@gmail.com` before signing or submitting employer-owned work. This
organizational authorization is reviewed manually; the automated `Rockxy CLA`
check verifies individual ICLA coverage and does not replace an executed CCLA.

Pull requests from contributors who have not signed the CLA will be blocked
from merging.

[GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later](LICENSE), subject to the
additional rights granted in the contributor agreement.
